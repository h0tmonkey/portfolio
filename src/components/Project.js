              As a front-end developer, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects that
              reflect my passion for clean design, responsive user interfaces,
              and interactive web experiences. My work spans from building
              dynamic single-page applications to optimizing performance for
              mobile-first platforms. Below are a few highlights of my recent
              projects:
            </p>
          </Col>
        </Row>
      </Container>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Project;
