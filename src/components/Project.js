                  <p>
                    As a front-end developer, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects
                    that reflect my passion for clean design, responsive user
                    interfaces, and interactive web experiences. My work spans
                    from building dynamic single-page applications to optimizing
                    performance for mobile-first platforms. Below are a few
                    highlights of my recent projects:
                  </p>
                  <Row>
                    {projects.map((item, index) => (
                      <ProjectCard
                        url={item.url}
                        title={item.title}
                        description={item.description}
                        imgUrl={item.imgUrl}
                        key={index}
                      />
                    ))}
                  </Row>
                </div>
              )}
            </TrackVisibility>
          </Col>
        </Row>
      </Container>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Project;
